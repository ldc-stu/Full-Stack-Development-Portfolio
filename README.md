# Full-Stack-Development-Portfolio

**_Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA)._**

Express with HTML and JavaScript involves creating static or server-rendered pages where the backend (Express) sends HTML files to the client. A straight forward method with modularity and simplicity but can be less interactive. On the other hand, a Single Page Application (SPA) leverages frameworks like Angular; where the entire application is loaded initially, and sequential interactions occur dynamically without a refresh.

**_Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?_**

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for its scalability, flexibility, and performance. MongoDB handles high traffic efficiently and integrates well with JavaScript/Node.js frameworks, making it an ideal choice for this project. 

**_How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?_**

JSON differs from JavaScript as a data interchange format versus a full-fledged programming language. It connects frontend and backend development by providing a standardized way to exchange data. The backend sends data to the frontend in JSON format, which the frontend can parse and display. On the other hand, the frontend can send user input/requests back to the backend in JSON, promoting better interaction between both sides.

**_Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components_**

An example of improved functionality would be the use of handlebars in order to reuse a page and repopulate it with different data. This reusing of UI components keeps the application memory friendly, ease overall development and better troubleshooting.

**_Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application._**

In a full stack application methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operate on endpoints defined by the backend API. Testing makes sure that things such as retrieve, create, update, and delete data correctly. Security layers, such as authentication/authorization adds a level of intricacy which ensures only those who are authorized have access.

**_How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?_**

This course of Full Stack Development covered fundamental skills like front/back end development, database management, server side scripting and API integration. Honing these skills can make you a more versatile and marketable candidate in the tech industry, as you would be capable of handling both client-side and server-side aspects of web applications effectively.
